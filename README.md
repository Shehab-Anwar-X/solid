# SOLID Principles

SOLID Principles are a set of guidelines for writing maintainable and scalable software systems. The
principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin in the early 2000s and have since become a
fundamental concept in software engineering.

## What are the SOLID Principles?

SOLID is an acronym that stands for:

- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **O**pen-Closed Principle (OCP)
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

The SRP states that a class should have only one reason to change. In other words, a class should
have only one responsibility. This principle helps in keeping the code maintainable and easier to
test.

### Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

The OCP states that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification. This principle
encourages the use of abstraction and polymorphism, which help in keeping the code maintainable and
scalable.

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

The LSP states that a derived class should be substitutable for its base class. This principle
ensures that the behavior of the base class is not affected by the introduction of a derived class.

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

The ISP states that a client should not be forced to depend on interfaces it does not use. This
principle encourages the use of smaller interfaces, which help in keeping the code maintainable and
easier to test.

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

The DIP states that a high-level module should not depend on a low-level module. Instead, both
should depend on abstractions. This principle encourages the use of dependency injection, which
helps in keeping the code maintainable and easier to test.

## Why are the SOLID Principles important?

The SOLID Principles help in developing maintainable and scalable software systems. By following the
principles, the code becomes easier to test, refactor, and extend. The principles also help in
reducing code smells, such as duplicate code, tight coupling, and high complexity.

## How to apply the SOLID Principles?

The SOLID Principles are not strict rules, but rather guidelines. The principles should be applied
based on the specific context and requirements of the project. However, some general guidelines for
applying the principles are:

- **SRP:** Each class should have only one responsibility.
- **OCP:** Use abstraction and polymorphism to make classes open for extension but closed for
  modification.
- **LSP:** A derived class should be substitutable for its base class.
- **ISP:** Use smaller interfaces to avoid forcing clients to depend on unused methods.
- **DIP:** Depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.

## Conclusion

The SOLID Principles are a fundamental concept in software engineering. By following the principles,
developers can write maintainable and scalable software systems that are easier to test, refactor,
and extend. The principles should be applied based on the specific context and requirements of the
project.
